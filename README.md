# Daily Dash

Daily Dash is a simple app that helps users track their daily progress on any activity by recording streaks and habits. Whether it's for exercising daily, reading, or any other habit, this app allows you to easily track your consistency and progress over time.

## Features

- **Add Streaks**: Users can create and manage streaks for any activity.
- **Add Habits**: Users can create and manage habits that track progress without requiring consecutive days.
- **Manual Updates**: Users update their streak manually each day to track their progress.
- **Streak Progress**: Track how many consecutive days you've achieved your goal.
- **Habit Progress**: Track your overall progress on habits, even if not done on consecutive days.
- **Polaroid Progress**: Save images as polaroids to visually represent your progress as it grows.

## Example Use Case

- **Streak Example**: If you want to exercise daily, you can create a streak for exercise and manually update it each day to track your consecutive days of exercising.
- **Habit Example**: If you want to read a book regularly but don’t mind skipping a day, you can create a habit for reading and manually update it whenever you complete your reading session.
- **Polaroid Example**: Capture a photo of your garden as it flourishes or your artwork as it progresses, saving it as a polaroid for a visual diary of your growth.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Streak or Habit**: Add a new streak or habit for any activity (e.g., "Exercise" for a streak or "Read a Book" for a habit).

2. **Update Progress**: Each day, manually update your streak or habit to reflect your progress:

3. **Streak**: Increase the count by 1 for consecutive days of progress. Missing a day will break the streak.

4. **Habit**: Increase the count by 1 whenever progress is made, regardless of consecutive days.

5. **Save Polaroid**: Capture an image that represents your progress and save it as a polaroid to document milestones visually.

6. **Track Progress**: View your streak count to see how many consecutive days you’ve maintained your streak, your total habit count for overall progress, or your polaroid gallery to reflect on your journey.

Daily Dash is the perfect tool for building habits, staying consistent in your goals, and celebrating your progress with visual memories!
