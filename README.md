# Streak Tracker

Streak Tracker is a simple app that helps users track their daily progress on any activity by recording streaks. Whether it's for exercising daily, reading, or any other habit, this app allows you to easily track your consistency and progress over time.

## Features

- **Add Streaks**: Users can create and manage streaks for any activity.
- **Manual Updates**: Users update their streak manually each day to track their progress.
- **Streak Progress**: Track how many consecutive days you've achieved your goal.
  
## Example Use Case

For example, if you want to exercise daily, you can create a streak for exercise and manually update it each day to track your consecutive days of exercising.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Streak**: Add a new streak for any activity (e.g., "Exercise", "Read a Book").
2. **Update Streak**: Each day, manually update your streak to reflect your progress (e.g., if you exercised today, increase your streak by 1).
3. **Track Progress**: See how many consecutive days you've maintained your streak.
